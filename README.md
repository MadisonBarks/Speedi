So I lie.
This won't be anything too special.
I mean, I'm still a student in university, and I literally JUST learned C/C++, like, a month ago.
So don't expect anything special out of it.

But there are some features that I have planned for this that will set it apart from others.
At least, in my opinion.

And honestly, I'm gonna be real.
This is just a contest between three friends, seeing who can write the fastest server.
But you're welcome to submit pull requests.
I honestly don't mind.


Future features going here.
